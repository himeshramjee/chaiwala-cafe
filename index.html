    <title>Cafe Chaiwala - Namaste</title>

      <h3>
        Welcome to the Chaiwala Cafe!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Chaiwala is produly South African and was started in the Mother City (Cape Town) from a little town called Hout Bay. We're a young Indian family that's using our daily meals to connect and delight our friends, family and neighbours!
      </p>

      <h4>What's on the stove?</h4>
      <p>
        Our menus are made up of delicious Gujerati snacks and meals - vegetarian only. These are typical in our household and what we've grown up on. In fact, the food we'll serve on any given day is almost always going to be exactly what we'll eat on that day. We see this as giving us a subtle yet important way of staying connected to our customers. We hope that you find delight in every mindful bite of our food.
      </p>

      <h4>Menus: Snacks and Hot meals</h4>
      <p>
        We've got 2 menus available. The first is a static menu focused on Delicious Snacks.
        The second is a saak menu (freshly made curry) that will change each week.
      </p>

      <h4>Mindful Eating</h4>
      <p>
        We're aiming to not be a typcial restaurant or food business. Our focus will always be on sharing our love for each other through food but most importantly in a healthy manner. My husband and I are both mindful of our mental and physical health. We're not where we want to be and the Chaiwala Cafe is a key mechanism of helping us improve ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means cooking with some well known healthy alternatives (e.g. coconut oil vs standard vegetable oil), offering many different vegetarian only meals and way more appropriate portion sizes that will fill bellies without, as my hubby always complains, going into a food coma üòÇ.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that our customers will enjoy our homemade meals in a mindful manner and knowing that we're sharing that meal with you in our home. Mindful eating will help us share the different smells, flavours, textures, combos and simple healthy approach we'll offer through our menus.
      </p>

      <h4>Hello from the Head Chef :)</h4>
      <p>
        Hi everyone! I'm Tershia Ramjee. Chaiwala Cafe has been a long standing dream for my hubby and I'm so excited to work with him on this. We're not quite sure how far we'll take this new endevour, but we're really excited to have gotten started! We love food (a bit too much!) and particularly the simple and delicious dishes that we've grown up on. I've always loved cooking and sharing our meals with friends and family around us. Chaiwala is a great way to continue this. Both in a way that keeps us connected in this new world of distancing and in helping support our families.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, the Chaiwala (my husband, Himesh Ramjee :)) and I decided that I would quit my practice as an Attorney & Notary and focus all my engery on our very young family. What started off as 2 strange looking aliens on a black and white picture are quickly exploding into these all consuming energies. Hehe ok, it did start with some great home cooked food and hot love making, but this is a family business so we'll just skip that part. lol :)
        I still miss my full time career but am humbled by how blessed I've been to be able to take this time off and focus on myself and our kids, Aayush and Aarya Ramjee. We love you two so much!
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm cooking from our home in Hout Bay and so we're staying local until we build up enough momentum and engery to expand; maybe someday. We know the little Republic will love our food and we're super excited to share our favorites and see all the good and constructive feedback we'll get! Hehe ok... and some bad feedback to help us grow. üòâ
      </p>

      <p>
        Lotsa ‚ù§Ô∏è,
        Tershia.
